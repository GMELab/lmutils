# lmutils

A collection of utilities for working with statistical models, particularly in the vein of MonsterLM and RARity.

## Installation

```bash
cargo add lmutils
```

## R Support
This library can be called from R using the lmutils.r package. To install it, run the following command in R:

```R
devtools::install_github("mrvillage/lmutils.r")
```

Please note that the R functionality integrated directly into the `lmutils` crate will likely not work when not called from R.
